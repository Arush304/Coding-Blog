        <h4><b>I am a 21st century Coding Geek</b></h4>
        <h6><i>With passion for innovative programming skills and ideas</i></h6>
        <p>My name is Arush Agarwal and I live in Dubai. I have many interests which include playing cricket, swimming, coding and science. I am interested in exploring various coding languages such as Python, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I know around 30% of python, and around 10% of CSS and HTML each. In the future, I want to try and learn JavaScript to code interactive and interesting. I enjoy spending my time coding various Python games. For example, recentely I have coded the snake game, a car game as well as Pong.</p>

        <h2>News about coding</h2>
        <p>

OpenAI released a new version of their language model, GPT-3, called GPT-3 175B. This version is the largest language model ever created, with 175 billion parameters, and it is capable of generating highly realistic text and completing a wide range of language tasks.

Google released a new programming language called "Dart," which aims to improve the speed and ease of coding for developers. It is designed to be used for building web, mobile, and desktop apps.

GitHub launched a new feature called "GitHub Discussions," which allows developers to have threaded conversations about their projects. This feature aims to make it easier for developers to collaborate and share knowledge with one another.

Chat GPT has been used in a variety of applications, including chatbots, language translation, and content creation. Some recent examples of Chat GPT in action include the creation of a virtual writing assistant called "Copy.ai" and a language translation service called "DeepL."
